# Automatic Number Plate Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting vehicle number plates using computer vision techniques. The notebook guides users through the entire detection pipeline, from image preprocessing to visualization of results.

**Features:**
1.Preprocessing and analysis of input images.
2.Detection of number plates using computer vision algorithms.
3.Visual display of detected number plates.
4.Clear and well-commented steps in the notebook.

**Technologies Used**
Python,
OpenCV,
NumPy,
Matplotlib,
Jupyter Notebook.

**Project Structure**
1.detection.ipynb — the main notebook file containing the detection logic.
2.README.md — overview and instructions for the project.

**Results**
The notebook shows images with highlighted number plates, demonstrating successful detection. This can be further extended to OCR for reading the plate text.
