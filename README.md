Preprocessing and analysis of input images

Detection of number plates using computer vision algorithms

Visual display of detected number plates

Clear and well-commented steps in the notebook

#Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Project Structure
detection.ipynb — the main notebook file containing the detection logic

README.md — overview and instructions for the project

Results
The notebook shows images with highlighted number plates, demonstrating successful detection. This can be further extended to OCR for reading the plate text.
